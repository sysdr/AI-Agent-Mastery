# Day 19: Distributed Agent Networks

A production-ready distributed AI agent system with secure peer-to-peer communication, consensus voting, and intelligent resource pooling.

## Features

- 🤖 **Multi-Agent Network**: 3 specialized AI agents working collaboratively  
- 🔐 **Secure Communication**: AES-256 encrypted P2P messaging with mutual authentication
- 🗳️ **Distributed Consensus**: Byzantine fault-tolerant voting for decision making
- 💾 **Resource Pooling**: Intelligent load balancing and cost optimization
- 📊 **Real-time Dashboard**: Live monitoring of network health and performance
- 🧪 **Test Coverage**: Comprehensive unit and integration tests

## Quick Start

### Option 1: Local Development
```bash
# Build and setup
./build.sh

# Start all services
./start.sh

# Open browser to http://localhost:3000

# Stop services
./stop.sh
```

### Option 2: Docker
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

## Architecture

- **Backend**: FastAPI + asyncio for high-performance concurrent processing
- **Frontend**: React with real-time WebSocket updates
- **Security**: Cryptographic agent identities with encrypted messaging
- **Consensus**: Weighted voting algorithm with reputation scoring
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus-style metrics with alerting

## Testing

```bash
# Backend tests
source venv/bin/activate
cd backend && python -m pytest tests/ -v

# Frontend tests  
cd frontend && npm test
```

## Usage

1. Open the dashboard at http://localhost:3000
2. Enter a problem in the "Collaborative Problem Solving" section
3. Watch agents communicate, vote, and reach consensus
4. Monitor network health and resource usage in real-time

## Production Considerations

- Horizontal scaling: Add more agents by modifying `num_agents` parameter
- Security: Replace demo encryption keys with production-grade certificates  
- Monitoring: Integrate with Prometheus/Grafana for observability
- Load balancing: Deploy behind nginx for production traffic
